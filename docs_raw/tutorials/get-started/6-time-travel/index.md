# 6. Time travel

# Time travel[¶](#time-travel "Permanent link")
In a typical chatbot workflow, the user interacts with the bot one or more times to accomplish a task. [Memory](../3-add-memory/) and a [human-in-the-loop](../4-human-in-the-loop/) enable checkpoints in the graph state and control future responses.
What if you want a user to be able to start from a previous response and explore a different outcome? Or what if you want users to be able to rewind your chatbot's work to fix mistakes or try a different strategy, something that is common in applications like autonomous software engineers?
You can create these types of experiences using LangGraph's built-in **time travel** functionality.
Note
This tutorial builds on [Customize state](../5-customize-state/).
## 1. Rewind your graph[¶](#1-rewind-your-graph "Permanent link")
Rewind your graph by fetching a checkpoint using the graph's `get_state_history` method. You can then resume execution at this previous point in time.

================================== Ai Message ==================================
Great idea! Building an autonomous agent with LangGraph is definitely an exciting project. Based on the latest information I've found, here are some insights and tips for building autonomous agents with LangGraph:
1. Multi-Tool Agents: LangGraph is particularly well-suited for creating autonomous agents that can use multiple tools. This allows your agent to have a diverse set of capabilities and choose the right tool for each task.
2. Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs): You can combine LangGraph with powerful LLMs like Gemini 2.0 to create more intelligent and capable agents. The LLM can serve as the "brain" of your agent, making decisions and generating responses.
3. Workflow Management: LangGraph excels at managing complex, multi-step AI workflows. This is crucial for autonomous agents that need to break down tasks into smaller steps and execute them in the right order.
...
6. Pay attention to how you structure the agent's decision-making process and workflow.
7. Don't forget to implement proper error handling and safety measures, especially if your agent will be interacting with external systems or making important decisions.
Building an autonomous agent is an iterative process, so be prepared to refine and improve your agent over time. Good luck with your project! If you need any more specific information as you progress, feel free to ask.

## 3. Replay the full state history[¶](#3-replay-the-full-state-history "Permanent link")
Now that you have added steps to the chatbot, you can `replay` the full state history to see everything that occurred.
```
to_replay = None
for state in graph.get_state_history(config):
    print("Num Messages: ", len(state.values["messages"]), "Next: ", state.next)
    print("-" * 80)
    if len(state.values["messages"]) == 6:
        # We are somewhat arbitrarily selecting a specific state based on the number of chat messages in the state.
        to_replay = state
```
```
Num Messages:  8 Next:  ()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  7 Next:  ('chatbot',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  6 Next:  ('tools',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  5 Next:  ('chatbot',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  4 Next:  ('__start__',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  4 Next:  ()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  3 Next:  ('chatbot',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  2 Next:  ('tools',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  1 Next:  ('chatbot',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  0 Next:  ('__start__',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Checkpoints are saved for every step of the graph. This **spans invocations** so you can rewind across a full thread's history.
## Resume from a checkpoint[¶](#resume-from-a-checkpoint "Permanent link")
Resume from the `to_replay` state, which is after the `chatbot` node in the second graph invocation. Resuming from this point will call the **action** node next.
```
print(to_replay.next)
print(to_replay.config)
```
```
('tools',)
{'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1efd43e3-0c1f-6c4e-8006-891877d65740'}}
```
## 4. Load a state from a moment-in-time[¶](#4-load-a-state-from-a-moment-in-time "Permanent link")
The checkpoint's `to_replay.config` contains a `checkpoint_id` timestamp. Providing this `checkpoint_id` value tells LangGraph's checkpointer to **load** the state from that moment in time.
```
# The `checkpoint_id` in the `to_replay.config` corresponds to a state we've persisted to our checkpointer.
for event in graph.stream(None, to_replay.config, stream_mode="values"):
    if "messages" in event:
        event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```
```
