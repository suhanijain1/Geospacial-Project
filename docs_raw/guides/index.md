# Guides[¶](#guides "Permanent link")
The pages in this section provide a conceptual overview and how-tos for the following topics:
## Agent development[¶](#agent-development "Permanent link")
* [Overview](../agents/overview/): Use prebuilt components to build an agent.
* [Run an agent](../agents/run_agents/): Run an agent by providing input, interpreting output, enabling streaming, and controlling execution limits.
## LangGraph APIs[¶](#langgraph-apis "Permanent link")
* [Graph API](../concepts/low_level/): Use the Graph API to define workflows using a graph paradigm.
* [Functional API](../concepts/functional_api/): Use Functional API to build workflows using a functional paradigm without thinking about the graph structure.
* [Runtime](../concepts/pregel/): Pregel implements LangGraph's runtime, managing the execution of LangGraph applications.
## Core capabilities[¶](#core-capabilities "Permanent link")
These capabilities are available in both LangGraph OSS and the LangGraph Platform.
* [Streaming](../concepts/streaming/): Stream outputs from a LangGraph graph.
* [Persistence](../concepts/persistence/): Persist the state of a LangGraph graph.
* [Durable execution](../concepts/durable_execution/): Save progress at key points in the graph execution.
* [Memory](../concepts/memory/): Remember information about previous interactions.
* [Context](../agents/context/): Pass outside data to a LangGraph graph to provide context for the graph execution.
* [Models](../agents/models/): Integrate various LLMs into your LangGraph application.
* [Tools](../concepts/tools/): Interface directly with external systems.
* [Human-in-the-loop](../concepts/human_in_the_loop/): Pause a graph and wait for human input at any point in a workflow.
* [Time travel](../concepts/time-travel/): Travel back in time to a specific point in the execution of a LangGraph graph.
* [Subgraphs](../concepts/subgraphs/): Build modular graphs.
* [Multi-agent](../concepts/multi_agent/): Break down a complex workflow into multiple agents.
* [MCP](../concepts/mcp/): Use MCP servers in a LangGraph graph.
* [Evaluation](../agents/evals/): Use LangSmith to evaluate your graph's performance.
