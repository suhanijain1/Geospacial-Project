## ✨ Contributing Your Library[¶](#contributing-your-library "Permanent link")
Have you built an awesome open-source library using LangGraph? We'd love to feature
your project on the official LangGraph documentation pages! 🏆
To share your project, simply open a Pull Request adding an entry for your package in our [packages.yml](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/docs/_scripts/third_party_page/packages.yml) file.
**Guidelines**
* Your repo must be distributed as an installable package on PyPI 📦
* The repo should either use the Graph API (exposing a `StateGraph` instance) or
  the Functional API (exposing an `entrypoint`).
* The package must include documentation (e.g., a `README.md` or docs site)
  explaining how to use it.
We'll review your contribution and merge it in!
Thanks for contributing! 🚀
