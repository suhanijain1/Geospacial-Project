# Time Travel ⏱️[¶](#time-travel "Permanent link")
When working with non-deterministic systems that make model-based decisions (e.g., agents powered by LLMs), it can be useful to examine their decision-making process in detail:
1. 🤔 **Understand reasoning**: Analyze the steps that led to a successful result.
2. 🐞 **Debug mistakes**: Identify where and why errors occurred.
3. 🔍 **Explore alternatives**: Test different paths to uncover better solutions.
LangGraph provides [time travel functionality](../../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/time-travel/) to support these use cases. Specifically, you can resume execution from a prior checkpoint — either replaying the same state or modifying it to explore alternatives. In all cases, resuming past execution produces a new fork in the history.
Tip
For information on how to use time travel, see [Use time travel](../../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/time-travel/) and [Time travel using Server API](../../cloud/how-tos/human_in_the_loop_time_travel/).
