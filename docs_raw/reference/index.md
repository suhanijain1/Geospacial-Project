# Reference[¶](#reference "Permanent link")
Welcome to the LangGraph reference docs! These pages detail the core interfaces you will use when building with LangGraph. Each section covers a different part of the ecosystem.
Tip
If you are just getting started, see [LangGraph basics](../concepts/why-langgraph/) for an introduction to the main concepts and usage patterns.
## LangGraph[¶](#langgraph "Permanent link")
The core APIs for the LangGraph open source library.
* [Graphs](graphs/): Main graph abstraction and usage.
* [Functional API](func/): Functional programming interface for graphs.
* [Pregel](pregel/): Pregel-inspired computation model.
* [Checkpointing](checkpoints/): Saving and restoring graph state.
* [Storage](store/): Storage backends and options.
* [Caching](cache/): Caching mechanisms for performance.
* [Types](types/): Type definitions for graph components.
* [Config](config/): Configuration options.
* [Errors](errors/): Error types and handling.
* [Constants](constants/): Global constants.
* [Channels](channels/): Message passing and channels.
## Prebuilt components[¶](#prebuilt-components "Permanent link")
Higher-level abstractions for common workflows, agents, and other patterns.
* [Agents](agents/): Built-in agent patterns.
* [Supervisor](supervisor/): Orchestration and delegation.
* [Swarm](swarm/): Multi-agent collaboration.
* [MCP Adapters](mcp/): Integrations with external systems.
## LangGraph Platform[¶](#langgraph-platform "Permanent link")
Tools for deploying and connecting to the LangGraph Platform.
* [SDK (Python)](../cloud/reference/sdk/python_sdk_ref/): Python SDK for interacting with instances of the LangGraph Server.
* [SDK (JS/TS)](../cloud/reference/sdk/js_ts_sdk_ref/): JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for interacting with instances of the LangGraph Server.
* [RemoteGraph](remote_graph/): `Pregel` abstraction for connecting to LangGraph Server instances.
See the [LangGraph Platform reference](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/reference-overview) for more reference documentation.
